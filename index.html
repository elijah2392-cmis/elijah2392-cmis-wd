				This assignment is about lists and links. I had to create a new file called listsandlinks.html. I had to create a very detailed, ordered, list of how to make a webpage. I had to then view my lists and link on a production server. Then I had to create an unordered list of helpful webdesign websites. Then, I had to create a link back to my index.html page, which also had a link back to my lists and links. Now, I am adding a description of this assignment. I will add declarations and style my box models. Then I will use two new selecter types. Finally, I will turn in my work.
